# api_poc -> MVO Minimal Viable Option -> Reduce Attack Surface

That's a very relevant and security-conscious question‚Äîespecially from someone working with minimal client-server infrastructure and PostgreSQL 
backends on hardened Linux systems like Fedora and Gentoo. Let's unpack the issue of JavaScript and what viable alternatives or mitigations exist.

---

## üß® **Is JavaScript a Security Concern?**

Yes, JavaScript can be a concern from a **security** and **complexity** standpoint:

### Why?

1. **Untrusted Client Execution**: JS runs on the client, and users can tamper with it. This means:

   * Never trust data coming from the client.
   * Attackers can bypass UI validation, tamper with API calls, or inject malicious behavior.

2. **Huge Dependency Trees**:

   * Frontend frameworks often pull in 100s of npm packages, many unvetted.
   * Typosquatting and supply chain attacks (e.g., [event-stream incident](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident)) are very real.

3. **XSS Risks**:

   * Improper sanitization leads to injection attacks (Cross-Site Scripting).
   * Dynamic DOM manipulation is inherently risky.

## üîê **How to Reduce the Attack Surface with JavaScript**

If you *must* use JavaScript (and in most browsers, you do), here are mitigation steps:

### 1. **Strict CSP (Content Security Policy)**

* Disallow inline scripts: `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'`
* Block external JS unless absolutely trusted.
* Consider `Trusted Types` to mitigate DOM-based XSS.

### 2. **Minimal JS or JS-Free Frontends**

* Use server-side rendering (SSR) where possible (e.g., with Rust or Haskell).
* Deliver pre-rendered HTML and hydrate only necessary parts.
* Avoid client-side routers and SPA complexity if not needed.

### 3. **Avoid npm Where You Can**

* Avoid bloated frontend stacks (React, Angular, etc.) for small or medium apps.
* Instead, use:

  * HTMX (for progressive enhancement via HTML-over-the-wire)
  * Alpine.js (minimal reactive JS with no build step)
  * Vanilla JS or static HTML+CSS when applicable

## üîÅ **Alternatives to JavaScript**

### 1. **ü¶Ä Rust with WebAssembly (Wasm)**

* **Pros**:

  * Strong typing, memory safety, no GC ‚Üí fewer runtime errors.
  * No dynamic typing weirdness.
  * Wasm can't access the DOM directly‚Äîsandboxed by default.
* **Cons**:

  * Still needs JS bindings to interact with DOM.
  * Build toolchain is heavier (e.g., `wasm-pack`, `trunk`, `yew` or `leptos`).

### 2. **üß† Haskell (via GHCJS or Asterius or Wasm)**

* **Pros**:

  * Purely functional ‚Üí easier to reason about, safer abstractions.
  * Can use the same language across frontend/backend.
* **Cons**:

  * Tooling is not as mature as JavaScript or Rust.
  * Performance may be worse compared to Rust/Wasm.

### 3. **üö´ No JS: Use HTMX + Server-Side Rendering**

* HTMX ([https://htmx.org/](https://htmx.org/)) lets you build highly dynamic UIs with almost no JavaScript.
* It sends AJAX requests and swaps HTML snippets returned from the server.
* Works perfectly with minimal API backends like your PostgreSQL stack.

## üß∞ Suggested Stack for Minimal, Safe Web Apps

Given your constraints (open source, PostgreSQL, Gentoo/Fedora, minimalism), here's a suggested "defensive" stack:

* **Backend**: Rust (`actix-web`, `axum`) or Haskell (`servant`, `yesod`)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (access via `sqlx` in Rust or `persistent` in Haskell)
* **Frontend**:

  * Static HTML + CSS
  * Optional: HTMX (minimal JS, powerful interactions)
  * Optional: Alpine.js (for reactive components, no build step)
* **Security**:

  * CSP headers
  * No inline JS or eval()
  * Validate everything server-side
  * CSRF tokens for mutating operations

## üìå TL;DR

| Language/Tool  | Security                   | Complexity         | DOM Access         | Notes                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| JavaScript     | ‚ùå XSS risk, too dynamic    | High w/ frameworks | Full access        | Use minimal, secure subset       |
| Rust (Wasm)    | ‚úÖ Memory safe, sandboxed   | Medium-High        | Via bindings       | Best for performance-critical UI |
| Haskell (Wasm) | ‚úÖ Pure functional safety   | High               | Via GHCJS/Asterius | Niche, safer but slower          |
| HTMX + HTML    | ‚úÖ Minimal JS, SSR friendly | Low                | N/A                | Great for secure, simple UIs     |
